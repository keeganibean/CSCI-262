Name: Keegan Bean
Collaborators: Linked lists cplusplus.com, CASA tutors, class slides, and previous labs/projects
Challenges: The challenge solutions came pretty quickly but the volume of the project was challenging and properly implementing these linked lists for all given and supporting functions was difficult.
Likes/Dislikes: I liked the practice on differents topics and how long we got for the assignment since it was so long but I disliked how the labs weren't all that helpful for this.
Time Spent: 10 hours
EC: I didn't add anything :(
