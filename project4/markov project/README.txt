I used cplusplus.com for map and vector review and also I researched markov on the internet
2. My largest trouble was understanding how to seed the program and formulate a proper output using the different formats, which I overcame by troubleshooting and looking through past projects and APT's

4. I spent about 6 hours working on this project
